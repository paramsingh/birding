## 12. Documentation Requirements

For each exploration task:
1. Document your findings with supporting evidence (plots, audio samples, statistics)
2. Highlight implications for model design and preprocessing
3. Identify follow-up questions that require deeper investigation
4. Note any surprising discoveries that might inform your approach

The goal of this exploration is to develop a thorough understanding of the acoustic characteristics and challenges in the BirdCLEF+ 2025 dataset, guiding the design of effective preprocessing, augmentation, and model architectures for the competition.
